# stock_picker

The goal of this small project is to write an algorithm that accepts an array of 7 integers, starting at index 0, then telling you which indexes to buy/sell from, for maximum value. You must buy first, and on occassion, the cheapest day may be the last, in which case you have to account for that as well.

I have interpreted the instructions given to me as: This must all occur in one week, so the last day can never be a "buy" day, and the first day can never be a "sell" day.
